# Pursuit of the Real

### Goal ###
A repository of scenes that can be compiled, forked/merged, and/or performed, to achieve something of greater value and integrity than a single person could imagine or accomplish.  The aim is to revive the ghosts of Shakespeare and the French Existentialists in service to art and humanity, at the expense of creator vanity and profit.

### Guiding Principles ###
- "Tell, Don't Show": The works are intended to be performed with limited/no resources for full accessibility. High-production elements must be disposable.
- Nothing overtly debase or divine: Liminal experiences are personal, subjective, and must be suggested, teased, or evoked instead of presented or forced.
- Everything written must be of some value to the narrative. This value doesn't need to be stated, but content without apparent value must be clarified or cut.
- Situation focus instead of character focus: Characters are informed by the reality they inhabit. They should be able to be adapted and broadly cast.

### Structure ###
The project will be broken into three sections, greyworks, greenworks, and goldworks:
- Greyworks are scenes, moments, and expressions.  They are individualized and can be adapted into a greater work.
- Greenworks are full arcs, acts, or productions, compiled and adapted from greyworks.  They are "in progress" works.
- Goldworks are greenworks that have been completed and are ready to be performed.  They are no longer "in progress".
 
Tags should be applied to all to identify themes, to assist with compiling greyworks into greenworks, and to find greenworks/goldworks for production.

### Licensing ###
This project is licensed under GNU GPL v3, and should never be used in a closed source, proprietary, and for-profit work.  The project must be cited in production materials, with instructions of how to find the goldwork being performed in the repository: Today's audience members are tomorrow's contributors.

### Ethics ###
Tickets should be priced as economically as possible with a non-profit mentality: Ticket sales should cover the costs of production and for use of the venue.  Any unintended additional profit should be shared equally among the cast and crew, with one portion allotted towards fronting costs of the next production.  Casting should be focused on finding amateurs with latent talent, and a director should actively resist favoritism or pre-planning in casting.
